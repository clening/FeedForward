# KEYWORDS CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# This file defines keywords for filtering RSS feed articles.
# Replace these examples with keywords relevant to your research interests.
#
# STRUCTURE:
# - Main categories start with single # (e.g., #Social)
# - Subcategories start with ## (e.g., ## Healthcare)
# - Keywords are listed one per line under their category
#
# IMPORTANT TIPS:
# - Avoid short acronyms (3-4 letters) that are common words or word parts
#   Examples to AVOID: "AI", "IoT", "abs", "sync", "use", "IT"
#   These will match unintended words and create false positives
# - Use longer, specific phrases when possible
# - Keywords are case-insensitive
# - The tool uses whole-word matching for short uppercase keywords
