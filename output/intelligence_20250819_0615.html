                <strong>📝 Summary:</strong><br>
                In an era where deepfakes blur reality and adversaries exploit the very fabric of our digital trust, the provenance of intelligence is no longer a niche concern for spy agencies; it is a critical differentiator for every organization, from the C-suite to the board room. The tools of commercial open-source intelligence (OSINT) have expanded dramatically, transforming what was once a supplementary discipline into a core operational necessity. The United States now formally legislates, defines policies and allocates resources to OSINT as a program of record, with allies across the Five Eyes and NATO following suit. Some, but not all, professional OSINT firms can be defined as “primary source collectors” when the majority of their intelligence is derived directly from data obtained by their own people. The business of collecting OSINT when working against dangerous criminals or sophisticated threat actors is not a business for amateurs. In some cases like the recent North Korean efforts to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies , professionally collected OSINT even needs to meet a federal evidentiary standard in order to support complex criminal prosecutions.

                Media Matters for America (MMFA)—a nonprofit that Elon Musk accused of sparking a supposedly illegal ad boycott on X —won its bid to block a sweeping Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe that appeared to have rushed to silence Musk's foe without ever adequately explaining why the government needed to get involved. Sooknanan—a Joe Biden appointee— agreed that the FTC's probe was likely to be ruled as a retaliatory violation of the First Amendment. Warning that the FTC's targeting of reporters was particularly concerning, Sooknanan wrote that the "case presents a straightforward First Amendment violation," where it's reasonable to conclude that conservative FTC staffers were perhaps motivated to eliminate a media organization dedicated to correcting conservative misinformation online.

                These bills—targeting what this analysis collectively calls “ data-driven pricing ”—follow the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s 2024 announcement that it was conducting a 6(b) investigation to study how firms are engaging in so-called “surveillance pricing,” and the release of preliminary insights from this study in early 2025. With new FTC leadership signalling that continuing the study is not a priority, state lawmakers have stepped in to scrutinize certain pricing schemes involving algorithms and personal data. The Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, and state Attorneys General have all stated their intentions to enforce against particular instances of algorithmic pricing. For example, the Colorado AI Act defines “consequential decision” to mean “a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on the provision or denial to any consumer of, or the cost or terms of …” the aforementioned categories. ” However, deidentified and aggregated information is not considered “personal information” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). In later versions, the bill authors aligned the definition in AB 446 with the text of the CCPA.

After that story, Apple added safety features like phone notifications when an Airtag is nearby, but an ongoing class action lawsuit argues that the devices are still insufficiently “stalker proof.

                The first generation of generative AI, including large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, tapped into a simpler form of associative learning called “supervised learning,” which trained the model on data sets that had been labeled by people. ”) Then, last fall, OpenAI revealed its o-series of large language models, which it classifies as “reasoning” models. ” Sutton, too, dismissed the claims of reasoning as “marketing” in an email, adding that “no serious scholar of mind would use ‘reasoning’ to describe what is going on in LLMs. ” The key, they argue, is building AI agents that depend less than LLMs on human dialogue and prejudgments to inform their behavior. A pigeon can experience pain and suffer, while an AI chatbot cannot—even if some large language models, trained on corpora that include descriptions of human suffering and sci-fi stories of sentient computers, can trick people into believing otherwise.
