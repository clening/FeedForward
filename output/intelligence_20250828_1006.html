                When a conservative governor in a business-friendly state completely abandons his own executive order after bipartisan legislative rebellion, something fundamental has shifted in how we think about where work happens. The bipartisan rebellion that followed wasn’t driven by ideology but by data.

                <strong>📝 Summary:</strong><br>
                In AI governance and public policy, the many trends of “personalization” are becoming clear, but often discussed and debated together, despite dissimilar uses, benefits, and risks. All LLMs are personalized tools insofar as they produce outputs that are responsive to a user’s individual prompts or questions. Long before LLMs, developers have been interested in giving voice assistants, voice features, and chatbots carefully designed “personalities” in order to increase user engagement and trust. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), a post-training technique organizations have used to align LLMs with human preferences, can contribute to sycophancy by causing systems to strive for user satisfaction and positivity rather than confront delusional behavior. This may cause harms similar to those of deepfakes , such as declines in the person’s reputation, mental health, and physical wellbeing through the spread of disinformation or misinformation.

                Key point: During Colorado’s legislative special session, which aimed to address budgetary shortfalls resulting from this year’s federal appropriations act, lawmakers approved a delay in the Colorado AI Act’s effective dates. Colorado lawmakers amended the Colorado AI Act, shifting the law’s effective date from February 1, 2026, to June 30, 2026. Whether the July 2025 White House AI Action Plan will provide further incentives or pressure on the legislature to revise the core obligations, as discussed here , is unclear.

                “On its website, Ofcom states that ‘over 100,000 online services are likely to be in scope of the Online Safety Act—from the largest social media platforms to the smallest community forum. Still, they have now become the entities fighting the hardest against the UK’s disastrous Online Safety Act , which requires websites and social media platforms to perform invasive age verification checks on their users, which often requires people to upload an ID or otherwise give away their personal information in order to access large portions of the internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said the Online Safety Act “is a threat to the privacy of users, restricts free expression by arbitrating speech online, exposes users to algorithmic discrimination through face checks, and leaves millions of people without a personal device or form of ID excluded from accessing the internet. ” Ofcom began investigating 4chan over alleged violations of the Online Safety Act in June. "Under the Online Safety Act, any service that has links with the UK now has duties to protect UK users, no matter where in the world it is based.

You can actually buy these things in Amazon and couple it to generative AI algorithm again, like Eddie Chang. Anyway, this is now becoming very common practice to choose generative AI to decode speech. All the data that's being gathered is covered by, you know, HIPAA and other state health data laws. They now have to provide the protections embedded in the California Consumer Privacy Act to all of their gathering and use of neural data, right.

William Bloch, a veteran Los Angeles lawyer who brought two malpractice cases against Terrell, said Terrell acted as “the carnival barker” to attract business, then failed to do the necessary legal work. In one sex-discrimination case, according to the resulting malpractice suit brought by Bloch, Terrell accepted a settlement from the city of Beverly Hills for “a pittance” despite explicit instructions from his client, a female police officer, to zealously pursue her claim.

                The top data official from the Social Security Administration is warning that the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency has put the Social Security information of more than 300 million Americans at risk of exposure to malicious actors. A new whistleblower disclosure from SSA Chief Data Officer Charles Borges reported that DOGE officials, while working at SSA, authorized themselves to create a live, cloud-based version of SSA’s entire dataset, containing personal information of millions of Americans. DOGE officials uploaded the dataset to a vulnerable system, without including measures for security or oversight, according to a whistleblower disclosure that the Government Accountability Project submitted to the Office of Special Counsel and multiple congressional committees this week. Officials employed at DOGE first sought access SSA’s data in January, after the Trump administration issued an executive order to establish DOGE as a federal entity , initially led by billionaire Elon Musk. A lawsuit in March temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to sensitive data at SSA. In June, the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the Trump administration in allowing DOGE to continue accessing the personal information of millions of Americans through Social Security’s data systems.

                A Social Security Administration (SSA) official alleged in a whistleblower disclosure that DOGE officials created "a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight. " Chuck Borges, the SSA's Chief Data Officer (CDO), "has become aware through reports to him of serious data security lapses, evidently orchestrated by DOGE officials, currently employed as SSA employees, that risk the security of over 300 million Americans' Social Security data," the Government Accountability Project said in a letter sent today to members of Congress and the US Office of Special Counsel. Although it has been widely reported that DOGE sought and obtained access to Social Security records in its attempt to find evidence of fraud, the letter to lawmakers said the live copy of SSA's database hasn't previously been disclosed. DOGE's actions were taken "under the authority of SSA Chief Information Officer (CIO) Aram Moghaddassi" and violate SSA protocols and policies, the letter said.

How AI can unlock faster, more informed decision-making The recent AI Action Plan recognizes that “AI is far too important to smother in bureaucracy. By using small language models (SLMs) — customized, compact versions of large language models — the DoD and U. Unlike general-purpose large language models, SLMs offer superior security, can run on classified networks, and can be fine-tuned specifically for defense acquisition terminology and requirements. Establish governance structures Create AI governance boards that include acquisition professionals, technologists, legal advisors and mission owners. As the AI Action Plan notes, the federal government should establish frameworks to “ensure that the government only contracts with frontier LLM developers who ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.

They found that the high amount of natural variability in climate model runs can cause the deep learning model to perform poorly on unpredictable long-term oscillations, like El Niño/La Niña.

                Despite success stories at Unilever and Kellanova , skepticism about generative AI is mounting across the wider business world. An MIT study published last week , which estimated that 95% of organizations that tried to implement generative AI into their workflows found zero return on their investment, sent AI-related stocks tumbling. In this candid conversation, an indie agency exec talks us through the collapse of their agency, which slid into administration in July after its founder and creative figurehead became convinced that generative AI tools would provide a silver bullet solution for existential business threats.
